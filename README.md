# Machine Learning Projects

#### A collection of simple machine learning and data science projects. 

### Purpose  

This repository contains a series of projects designed to demonstrate fundamental concepts in machine learning and data science. Each project is a self-contained example of a specific technique or algorithm.
   
### Contents   
 
**sentiment_analysis_imdb**: A sentiment analysis project using the IMDB dataset and Keras. 
+ sentiment_analysis_imdb.py: The Python code for the sentiment analysis model.
+ walkthrough.txt: A detailed walkthrough of the code and its implementation.  

**fraud_detection_basic**: A fraud detection project utilising the Kaggle fraud detection dataset.   
+ fraud_detection.py: The Python code for the fraud detection autoencoder.     
+ walkthrough.txt: A detailed walkthrough of the code and its implementation.         
  
**fraud_detection_advanced**: A continuation of 'fraud_detection_kaggle', introducing an XGBoost supervised model atop the autoencoder. 
+ fraud_detection_hybrid.py: The Python code for the fraud detection hybrid autoencoder-XGBoost. 
+ walkthrough.txt: A detailed walkthrough of the code for the machine learning model and its implementation.
+ summary-of-results.txt: A list of the results from running the hybrid model, including 99.81% AUC.
